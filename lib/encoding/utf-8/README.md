# UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8)

A Unicode block is one of several contiguous ranges of numeric character codes
(code points) of the Unicode character set that are defined by the Unicode
Consortium for administrative and documentation purposes. Typically, proposals
such as the addition of new glyphs are discussed and evaluated by considering
the relevant block or blocks as a whole.

Each block is generally, but not always, meant to supply glyphs used by one or
more specific languages, or in some general application area such as
mathematics, surveying, decorative typesetting, social forums, etc.
